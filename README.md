# ENEM Project
Hello! This project aims to provide insights into the Brazilian national exam for medium-level students, known as ENEM (Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃ©dio).

I have conducted an analysis of various aspects, including participant demographics, exam locations, and the final results of the participants.

For data management, I utilized a SQL Server database. The analytical part of the project was implemented using pyspark within Jupyter Notebooks. Furthermore, the dashboards were created using Apache Superset.

In this first phase, I created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on modeling the Data Warehouse using Snowflake, where I have one fact table and dimensions:

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance with your project!
